Want to create subdomain madhwa under abjaja.in in https://transform.herosite.pro:2222/evo/user/subdomains where there an option ADD SUBDOMAIN and want to link https://harihargithub.github.io/Achaaryaah/quiz/q1.html

To create a subdomain `madhwa.abjaja.in` and link it to `https://harihargithub.github.io/Achaaryaah/quiz/q1.html`, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Your Hosting Control Panel**:
   - Go to [transform.herosite.pro:2222/evo/user/subdomains](https://transform.herosite.pro:2222/evo/user/subdomains).

2. **Add Subdomain**:
   - Click on the `ADD SUBDOMAIN` button.
   - Enter `madhwa` as the subdomain.
   - Enter `abjaja.in` as the domain.
   - Set the document root to the desired directory (e.g., `public_html/madhwa` or as required by your hosting provider).
   - Submit the form to create the subdomain.

3. **Configure CNAME Record**:
   - Go to the DNS settings for your domain (`abjaja.in`).
   - Add a CNAME record for `madhwa.abjaja.in` pointing to `harihargithub.github.io`.

4. **Verify and Test**:
   - Allow some time for DNS propagation.
   - Verify that accessing `madhwa.abjaja.in` redirects to `https://harihargithub.github.io/Achaaryaah/quiz/q1.html`.

By following these steps, you should successfully create the subdomain and link it to your GitHub Pages site.


ADD NEW SUBDOMAIN
Subdomain madhwa .abjaja.in
Document Root - Defa - /domains/madhwa.abjaja.in/public_html

I am in https://transform.herosite.pro:2222/evo/user/dns which has a big list viz. abjaja.in, ftp, madhwa, mail, pop, smtp, www, www.madhwa - TTL 3600 & Type A then abjaja.in - NS then abjaja.in - 3600 MX and so on so please advise where to add CNAME pointing to harihargithub.github.io ?
 
 Click on Add Record then

Record Type Cname selected, Name when I give as madhwa for.abjaja.in it says A A record already exists with that name, TTL 3600 & Value - when I give as harihargithub.github.io it says Result: harihargithub.github.io.abjaja.in
Please add a period symbol at the end of the domain name if domain
should not be auto-appended.

To resolve the issue, you need to add a period at the end of the CNAME value to prevent it from being auto-appended. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Add Record" button.
2. Select "CNAME" as the record type.
3. Enter `madhwa` as the name or subdomain.
4. Enter `harihargithub.github.io.` as the target or value (note the period at the end).
5. Set the TTL to `3600` (or leave it as is).
6. Save the record.

This will correctly create the CNAME record pointing `madhwa.abjaja.in` to `harihargithub.github.io`.

It seems that an A record for `madhwa.abjaja.in` already exists. You need to either delete the existing A record or choose a different subdomain name to avoid conflicts.

If you want to proceed with using `madhwa.abjaja.in`, follow these steps:

1. **Delete the Existing A Record**:
   - Locate the A record for `madhwa.abjaja.in` in your DNS settings.
   - Delete this A record to free up the subdomain name.

2. **Add the CNAME Record**:
   - Click on the "Add Record" button.
   - Select "CNAME" as the record type.
   - Enter `madhwa` as the name or subdomain.
   - Enter `harihargithub.github.io.` as the target or value (note the period at the end).
   - Set the TTL to `3600` (or leave it as is).
   - Save the record.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully create the CNAME record for `madhwa.abjaja.in`.

madhwa.abjaja.in
. DNS Check in Progress

Is this the reason I am unable to ticket Enforce HTTPS?

Yes, the "DNS Check in Progress" status indicates that GitHub Pages is still verifying the DNS configuration for `madhwa.abjaja.in`. This is likely the reason you are unable to enable HTTPS enforcement. Once the DNS check is complete and the configuration is verified, you should be able to enforce HTTPS.

DNS check successful but Enforce HTTPS â€” Unavailable for your site because a certificate has not yet been issued for your domain (madhwa.abjaja.in)

The "Enforce HTTPS" option will become available once GitHub automatically issues an SSL certificate for your custom domain. This process can take a few hours. 

Please check back later to see if the certificate has been issued. Once it is available, you will be able to enable HTTPS enforcement.

It appears that there is no `CNAME` file in the `harihargithub/Achaaryaah` repository.

If you need to create or update the `CNAME` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub: [Achaaryaah](https://github.com/harihargithub/Achaaryaah).
2. Click on the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".
3. Name the file `CNAME`.
4. In the editor, enter your custom domain (e.g., `madhwa.abjaja.in`).
5. Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section.
6. Add a commit message, for example, "Add CNAME file for custom domain".
7. Choose "Commit directly to the `main` branch".
8. Click "Commit new file".

This will create the `CNAME` file in your repository and configure GitHub Pages to use your custom domain.

The main domain `abjaja.in` will work fine as long as you only add a CNAME record for the subdomain `madhwa.abjaja.in`. The main domain's configuration won't be affected by this change.
