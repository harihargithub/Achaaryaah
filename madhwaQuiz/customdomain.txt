To serve your GitHub Pages site from a custom domain, follow these steps:

1. **Add a CNAME File**:
   - In the root of your repository, create a file named `CNAME`.
   - Add your custom domain (e.g., `abjaja.in`) to the `CNAME` file.

2. **Configure DNS Settings**:
   - Log in to your domain registrar's website (MilesWeb in your case).
   - Go to the DNS settings for your domain.
   - Add a CNAME record pointing your custom domain to `harihargithub.github.io`.

3. **GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Navigate to your repository's settings on GitHub: [Repository Settings](https://github.com/harihargithub/SrimadAcharyaah/settings/pages).
   - In the "Custom domain" section, enter your custom domain and save.

4. **Ensure HTTPS**:
   - After setting up the custom domain, ensure that "Enforce HTTPS" is enabled in the GitHub Pages settings.

By following these steps, your GitHub Pages site will be served from your custom domain.


To create a `CNAME` file in the root of your repository and add your custom domain, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Repository**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub: [SrimadAcharyaah](https://github.com/harihargithub/SrimadAcharyaah).

2. **Create the `CNAME` File**:
   - Click on the "Add file" button and select "Create new file".
   - Name the file `CNAME`.

3. **Edit the `CNAME` File**:
   - In the editor, enter your custom domain (e.g., `abjaja.in`).
   - The file should contain only the domain name with no extra text or formatting.

4. **Commit the New File**:
   - Scroll down to the "Commit new file" section.
   - Add a commit message, for example, "Add CNAME file for custom domain".
   - Choose "Commit directly to the `main` branch".
   - Click "Commit new file".

Your repository should now have a `CNAME` file with your custom domain. This will configure GitHub Pages to use your custom domain.

Adding a CNAME record pointing `abjaja.in` to `harihargithub.github.io` will direct traffic for `abjaja.in` to your GitHub Pages site. If you want to keep the existing site at `abjaja.in` unaffected, you can instead create a subdomain (e.g., `pages.abjaja.in`) and point that subdomain to `harihargithub.github.io`.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. Log in to your domain registrar's website (MilesWeb).
2. Go to the DNS settings for your domain.
3. Add a CNAME record for the subdomain (e.g., `pages.abjaja.in`) pointing to `harihargithub.github.io`.

This way, the main site at `abjaja.in` will remain unaffected, and your GitHub Pages site will be accessible at `pages.abjaja.in`.
